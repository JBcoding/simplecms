Tut-files

ONLY FOR LEARNING PURPOSES!!
- SHOULD NOT BE USED IN ONLINE WORK - ONLY LOCALHOST!

These files are for training and learning for my students in Communication & IT A. As such they are designed to make learning 
a specific part of php easier, and therefore in no way secure for online work.

But you are more than welcome to extend, develop and improve every little bit of this mini-CMS ;-)

Kind Regards,
Michael Hanson
